A clock for those who never want to miss a good 4:20 partaking.

* DSC1307 Real time clock (breakout board)
* Adafruit 7-segment display for clock (12-hour time)
* Adafruit 14-segment Alphanumeric Display (displays day of week)
* At 4:20pm, it plays a tune (currently, Game of Thrones theme) and blinks alternating LED's
* Auto-dimming Switch (photocell)
* Daylight Savings Button
* Nightlight (backlight module)
* Potentiometers (3) to adjust brightnesses
* "Reminder" switch (Adafruit Neopixel Shield (40 RGB-LED)) fades colors
* Adjust time manually (4 buttons: +hour, -hour, +minute, -minute)


Future Improvements
-------------------
* Mute 4:20 alarm (need additional pin)
* Add additional user-adjustable alarm
* Put it in the box :D
